# sopel_modules

Utility scripts for Sopel Bot:

https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/wiki/Sopel-tutorial%2C-Part-2


To install `sopel` to experiment:

`sudo pip install sopel`

When run the first time a text based wizard will ask you the configuration for the connection to server and it will save its config in `~/.sopel`

To run:
```
sopel
```
Modules scripts need to be copied directly into `~/.sopel/modules`, it seems subdirectories do not work.
